# GitHub Flow

> **GitHub flow** is sometimes used as a nickname to refer to a flavor of trunk-based development  
  when code is deployed straight from feature branches. This list is just an interpretation  
  that I use in my [DevOps courses](http://redpill.solutions).  
  The official tutorial is [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
